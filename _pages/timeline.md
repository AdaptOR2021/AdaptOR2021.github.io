### Publication
Challenge submission should be accompanied by an 8-page **LNCS format paper**, describing individual methods by the participants in detail (methods adhering to the same schedule of the workshop). As of now, this paper will be published in the „Deep Generative Model“ workshop proceedings after the workshop. There are no restrictions on the number of authors.

After the challenge, the challenge organizers will publish **a challenge journal paper** (preferable TMI or MedIA) together with two participants of each challenge team summarizing the results. Each team should nominate two authors (typically the first and last author). An embargo period until the availability of this journal paper will be put in place for data usage.
